## **Well it has been a long time...** ##
I have been so busy that time slips by unknowingly; without noticing, a month has passed since I checked in on this blog.

**Since it has been a long time, this will be a long post.**
These are the topics I will touch on today:

1) Assignment 3: Snipit 

2) We decided to team up with SGInnovate for Assignment 4

3) My thoughts on assignments 1 & 3

4) My thoughts on being a product guy

## **Assignment 3: Snipit**

My teammates were a bunch of travel buffs. When we were generating product ideas, we started to map out the user flow of a person who plans his/her next travel adventure. 

The current workflow of a typical travel planner involves:

- Googling 'Top 10 attractions in XXX'
- Going to websites such as trip advisor to search for top rated destinations
- Asking friends who travelled to that location before
- Creating some sort of collaborative document (If > 1 traveller) to compile interesting places to visit, budgeting and excessive planning 
- Visiting various travel blogs and reading about how awesome a certain destination is

Although it may vary from person to person, the current workflow of a travel planner does not seem too simple. Our team believes that an easier way for people to plan trips is simply to refer to people's itineraries. Hence, SnipIt was conceived. 

### *SnipIt = Snippets + Itineraries.* ###

A simple onboarding tutorial that I designed - Basically, SnipIt helps users discover and explore new itineraries, save snippets of itineraries they like and build their own itineraries out of that!

However, we only had 3 weeks to build this product (Actually maybe 2 and a half weeks if you include ideation) - A gross lack of time for a proper usable product. This resulted in sleepless nights and lousy code. (More on this later!)

## **Assignment 4: SGInnovate, Talent Intelligence Team** ##
[SGInnovate](www.sginnovate.com) is a government backed startup ecosystem play that focuses mainly on deep tech startups.

We chose to collaborate with them due to a few reasons.

- They took us seriously - They had a good compensation package for our team. (Unlike Garuda Robotics) Even better, they actually made an office for us in BLK71 - I don't think we will even use it. But they take us seriously, period.
- Calvin. He knew his shit, and he knew what he wanted (vaguely). Because of this, we knew that the products that we create here at SGInnovate will actually see the light at the end of the tunnel. After building so many (unused) products, this is a very critical consideration.
- They had real problems (More on this)

Because of this, I am now a product intern in SGInnovate for 6 weeks. Our team consists of engineers and designers with the following roles:

Yi Hang (The Guru/Team Leader) - Full Stack Engineer

Jia Yee - Back End Engineer

Jun Wei - Front End Engineer

Jovin - UI/UX Developer & Product

After our first meeting with the talent intelligence team, we realised that they have a real problem - they had a tedious and messy workflow. This makes their operations unscalable since the learning curve is steep - if the volume of talent flow and job requests increases, the team will not likely be able to handle it.

The above Sketch shows their existing workflow. To help them streamline their workflows, we have came up with 3 products:

1) New Touch Point Product

2) Centralised Backend Database

3) Talent Intelligence Management Platform

I will elaborate on these products in a seperate blog post.

As you can see, we are on a tight schedule here.

## **My thoughts on Assignments 1 & 3** ##
Warning: My intention here is not to critique or bash anything. It is simply to make an opinion and hopefully serve as constructive feedback to future classes of CS3216.

CS3216 is the most useful module I have taken in university so far. However, I feel that there are some pitfalls and ways to improve the module. Firstly, is this module more on kickass digital products or software engineering?

At its current stage, I believe that it is more on the latter. I know that Assignments 1 & 3 are for us to 'warm up' to assignment 4. However, I also do not see the point in creating redundant products based on our 'hypothesis' and make believe users. In summary, we do not have enough time to do user testing. Heck, we do not even have enough time to sleep or eat. Most of the 'learning' comes from struggling massively while trying to create a workable app. 

This have certain negative results:

- Students do not care about what they produce. 'Just make an app that is easy to implement' - this kills innovation and real products.
- There is no time to generate good ideas. We have to jump in and start building right away, or face certain death.
- 'Just hit the milestones' mentality. This is not something to be expected from a module focused on product development.

I really love what CS3216 is trying to do here, but I believe that the module itself can be refined through user interviews/testing (Myself is an example). I know that there may be certain restrictions or reasons why it is currently structured this way, but I will also list down my recommendatons here.

A sucessful digital product is created by an intersection of skills - Business, Design and Engineering. Perhaps all assignments can be structured such that it taps on all 3 skillsets - maybe shorten and truncate it into 2 main assignments - one external and one internal project. This encourages ownership of product from the students and the business guys (who can't design) can finally do something for the first few assignments. 

Perhaps, the TAs can conduct user interviews with students after the module to see how it can be improved. I am sure some of my classmates have similar thoughts.

## **Life of a product guy** ##

I always knew that I wanted to work in the tech industry; the only thing that eluded me thus far is - 'what'?

Now I vaguely know 'what' I want. Last week, I visited Yan (COO of 99.co), my mentor. I talked to him about being a product guy in the future and he agreed that it may be the best path for me. His advice? Focus on UX. Oh, and learn fast - very very fast. 

A product manager needs to know so much. An intersection of engineering, business & design. But at the end of the day, does it appeal to your users? It all boils down to users, users, users.

That being said, I believe that product is where the true innovation happens in any tech company. This is where I want to belong, in the heart of innovation. Just think about it briefly, If you strip away the products - the sales team, operations team, design team, engineering team - where do they stand? From CS3216 and my other experiences, I believe that I am starting to connect the dots. For now, I shall try to gun for a product manager/developer internship for the next phase of my learning. I am hopeful that this will finally be my calling.

It is time to get busy. Will try to update my posts more frequently :)
