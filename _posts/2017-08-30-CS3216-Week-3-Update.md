## **The Grind is Real...**

### **Assignment 1 was not as easy as it seemed.**

 During the week, I completely redesigned the UI/UX for our website. nuseats v1.0 has upgraded to nuseats v2.0 - As I am writing this blog, I have already interviewed enough users to improve the UI/UX further to nuseats v2.1. As you can see, my lovely v1.0 logo has changed radically - From an innocent little yellow square fella, it has blossomed into a badass looking yellow fork which wears a red scarf. Well, at least it looks cooler now in my opinion.

The comment for v1.0's logo was: "No relevance to food, and is that big brother staring down at you?". I would like to stage a minor protest - Logos like Nike don't really explicitly say sportswear too. How about mascots like reddit's Snoo? Anyway, im not exactly complaining since our mascot/logo is a huge improvement from v1.0.

### **Assignment 2 - ForestApp, a pretty good choice!**

We were assigned ForestApp for our second project. We felt that it was novel enough, such that it gave us many good points to consider and present about. Interestingly enough, this has actually been the top paid productivity app for a long time. Over 1 - 5 million people have downloaded the app, which puts its revenue in a good range of around 2 - 10 million USD. According to product hunt, they are only a team of 4 (Not sure if they expanded the team). Such a simple app idea has the power to scale so quickly and land the founders in riches. Luck? I think maybe. But more importantly, the idea is brilliant.

Hopefully, assignment 4 will be filled with brilliant ideas (Maybe the magic number here is a team of 4). More importantly, I hope that we will have a product that we are proud of owning and showcasing when STEPs comes our way. That being said, I am still on a hunt for an inspiring idea. I try to go out of my comfort zone to talk to more people and experience different experiences. 

My theory is that inspiration hits only when you go all out to seek it - only if you dare to peer over the abyss. If anyone has a brilliant idea, do contact me at liewyyjovin@gmail.com - I am very willing to listen to any and every idea. (I need plenty this semester... We all do.)

Even though sleep is getting scarce, I am still facing the challenges optimistically. The desire to learn carries me a long way. Gotta work harder, smarter and faster!
