## **Assignment 2 Application Critique: Ello**

Ello is a small online social networking startup, which pivoted away from its earlier Facebook-like model towards a Pinterest-like website which showcases art, photography, fashion and web culture. Truth be told, The first thought that went through my mind was: "Oh another social media wannabe?". 

### **So how is Ello different?**

* "You are not a product" - They promise that they will never sell data (SHOCKING! This is highly profitable today in the digital advertising space)
* Never show advertisements - Again, how the hell are they going to monetise?
* Not enforce a real-name policy - Not a revolutionary idea, Reddit anyone?

Looking at the Users, they have a meagre 1 Million + users, with a poor retention of 20% after 1 week of usage. Compared to Facebook or Pinterest, Ello has a very small and niche user base. Although its privacy and non-data harvesting rules may be a product differentiator, I wonder if they can sustain their business model in the long run. After all, burning investor's money is never a good business model to have.

### **Now students, don't build something that requires users to have friends ...**

Su Yuen and Yi Hang both pointed out something that I felt was very important. For a social network to truly work, it must reach a critical mass in order for it to achieve network effects. Without the network effects, it will be hard for Ello to retain its users (Hence its poor retention rate) as they do not lose much value when they migrate to an alternative social media platform. Facebook for example, had a retention rate of 50% to 55% when it was first starting out - vastly superior compared to Ello today.

In economics, a network effect is the effect that one user of a service has on the value of the same service to others. In short, the Facebook platform is valuable to users because many other users are on it. Unless a competing platform can build a critical mass of users to benefit from network effects, users are unlikely to migrate away from the platform. This works the opposite way for Ello. Unless they can build a platform of critical mass, they are going to have a hard time when it comes to user retention - sustainability is a huge problem here.

### **Buttons, buttons everywhere...**
 
A common problem I saw during the application critique was the dilemma of balancing UI and UX. (ForestApp has the same problem as Ello). Trying to make an app too minimalistic may result in a ruined UX. Ello tried too hard to make itself simple and minimalistic, perhaps a futile attempt to look different from its main competitor, Facebook. 

This backfired on them in a harsh way - Icons did not make sense anymore. Users had no idea what each icon does - pair that with a ever growing feature bloat. Now that is a deadly combination. A fine balance between UI and UX is needed in order to created a good experience for the users, this usually takes multiple rounds of testing and perfecting before launch.

### **The age of speed**

Page loading time is an important part of any website's user experience - Ello sacrificed a portion of their page load time in order to accomodate for better images to load as it is supposedly supposed to cater for the artistic niche target audience. Unfortunately, I believe that webisite visitors tend to care more about speed compared to all the extra functionalities and fancy images that Ello tries to have. Furthermore, page loading time is becoming an important factor when it comes to SEO an search engine rankings.

Load speed is even more relevant when it comes to today's mobile age. Users are easily frustrated when they encounter a 'slow' loading website - they will exit the application and browse something else instead. Hence, Ello should concentrate on optimising their slow and laggy pages and reduce the heavy data usage that they currently require.

### **Conclusion**

This assignment exposed us to a wide array of apps and different business models. I would say that there are many learning points and it is a short but useful assignment nonetheless. Looking at Ello from an investor's standpoint, it does not look very attractive in terms of the qualitative aspect (and factoring in retention rate). There are many aspects that they can improve on, and I am sure they are trying to improve on. Maybe one day Ello may achieve its dream of being an anti-facebook establishment. By a moonshot, maybe even take over Facebook? Until then, they can only struggle to stay afloat and stay delusional.
