## **New Zealand is a gorgeous, breathtaking country**

**Warning: This will be an incredibly long post plastered with many (too many) photos**

On 28th August, 2017, I ended my internship at [99.co](99.co). Immediately afterwards, I hopped onto a 747 jet and flew far far away to New Zealand, a paradise for young, thrill seeking adventurers; or for anyone who wants to escape the hectic urban lifestyle. Together with 3 other army friends (Hakim, Ashwin and Xuan Yi), we begun our grand journey to explore the southern island of New Zealand. I took a seperate flight for them thanks to my mum (Free Kris Flyer miles, thanks mum!)

Now seat back, relax, and allow me to share my experience. 

&nbsp;

### **Day 1: A slow, lonely day in the beautiful gardens of Christchurch**

In case you didn't know, Christchurch is also known as **'The Garden City'**. After taking a 45-minute bus ride to my hostel (A cute prison themed hostel), I tossed my luggage into the storeroom and departed for the famous botanic gardens in Christchurch. Since it was the winter season, most trees were undergoing abscission. Rows of trees lined up orderly along the dirt track, puddles of melted snow formed mini lakes around the foilage. It was strangely romantic as I observed couples and families enjoying the cool breeze and warm sun. I poped in my airpods and made rounds around the garden, it took me 3 hours to cover most of the garden (It was a very huge garden).

 Afterwards, I wandered around aimlessly until my friends arrived around 5pm NZ time. It was surprising to see many locals utilising the facilities in the gardens - there were rugby and netball games, and also some sort of remote control boating competition going on. It was kind of a luxury to wander aimlessly alone.

&nbsp;

### **Day 2: Swimming in a gorgeous gorge in Hokitika**

On our second day, we drove from Christchurch through Aurther's Pass and checked in to **Mountain Jade Backpackers**, a pretty nifty, cozy backpacker's inn. After chucking our bags into the hostel, we sped our way down to the **Hokitika Gorge**. It was a beautiful gorge that had a mix of sapphire and emerald colored water. According to the informational signboard, this beautiful phenomenon was caused by the melting of glacial caps from the surrounding mountains. It was a cold day, with temperatures averaging at 8 to 10 degrees celcius. 

We decided to go for a swim after eating our tuna sandwiches. Hakim and Ashwin thought we were savages while Xuan Yi and I took turns stripping to our pants and jumping into the freezing gorge. When I hit the water, my leg instantly turned numb. After inhaling a deep breathe, I submerged myself completely into the water. Instant regret. Before I knew it, I was on the shore shivering uncontrollably. Nevertheless, it was a refreshing experience - living my life one reckless decision at a time.

### **Day 3: The day where we didn't do shit**

As the subtitle suggests, it was a lazy day. We spent the whole day on the road, taking photos, blasting music and crusing gleefully along the highway. We arrived at our motel, **Pine Grove Motel**. It was incredibly backward. 

Upon arrival, the owner gave us a carton of milk and announced that he forgot the wifi password. Oh good lord. He called his wife afterwards and found out the password, then he broke another unfortunate news to us. To use the wifi, we have to camp right outside the office building. It was a 3 minute drive from our lodge. Great. Since it was raining, we camped right outside the office, with the heater tuned to the max. We spent the rest of the day watching game of thrones and bidding for our modules.

&nbsp;

### **Day 4: Roy's Peak - where the clouds become the sea**

Standing at a height of **1,578 metres**, Roys Peak rose above the fluffy white cloud and was coated by a new layer of puffy white snow. We started the day early at 4am, made our way down to the track and immediately begun our adventure.

&nbsp;


After 3 hours, we rose above the main ridgeline of the mountain. **It was truly breathtaking.** I charged forward as my friends were busily snapping away at the scenery. I sat atop a large round rock that protruded out of the coat of snow and stared into the beautiful scenery. It was times like this where I just wished that I could just take a mental snapshot and stash it away in some corner of my brain so that I can have the pleasure of revisiting it anytime, anywhere.

&nbsp;


### **Day 5: Chilling in Wanaka**

A slow day, we woke up at 11am, chilled till lunchtime. Afterwards, we visited the famous lake wanaka tree and called it a day.

&nbsp;

### **Day 6: Onwards to Te Anau**

We spent the whole day on the route, snapping pictures as we go. My friends picked up a pretty intermediate bboy move after 10 minutes of coaching. I witnessed the true powers of social media (ahem, Instagram). 

Nothing much was done, just driving, reading and enjoying the beautiful scenery as we trailed on.

&nbsp;

### **Day 7: The eighth wonder of the world, Milford Sound**

We took a day tour, which was a 3 hour ride to Milford Sound. **Milford Sound is truly special.** Remote and untouched, it serves a spectacular array of mountaineous features, with waterfalls cascading down from above. It is blessed (or cursed) with heavy volumes of rainfall (Up to 7 metres of rainfall per year). This massive amount of rainfall coats the mountains in thick puffy snow and keeps the glaciers alive.

It is exclusively remote. In summer times, only 300 people populate the city. During winter, a pathetic 100 headcount. **A strong warning for internet addicts: There is no wifi and no signal in this quirky little town. Do bring a portable wifi if your addiction is unbearably strong.**

 An interesting little fact: they have a special little tunnel called the **Homer Tunnel**, which took 20 years to dig and construct. The mountain that is drilled through is made of solid granite. Painstakingly, workers had to work through the granite using explosives, which only unearthed the granite centimeter by centimeter. Oh, and they have a naked tunnel run annually at 1 Jan (Would totally do).

When we reached the area, we suited up layers upon layers of stripy warm clothing, tossed a flashy yellow jacket over our heads, and set sail into the vast, clear lake in our kayaks. We marvelled at the beauty of Milford Sound and chomped down on our lunch while kayaking around the area. It was a fun day (A place you should definitely visit, I would reccommend the cruise if you are not physically fit, or dislike physical activities.)

### **Day 8: Mountain Biking and Strange Hostels in Queenstown**

Early in the day, we set out for Queenstown after preparing sandwiches for lunch. We immediately rented some mountain bikes and cycled around the city for the whole day. 

We also tried searching for souvenirs and gifts to buy, but realised that New Zealand is a shithole when it comes to shopping. The gifts were horrendous. Gift shops were duplicate of each other, the stuffed toys look like they will murder you at night, the keychains were tacky and wacky. A total nightmare.

Before the day came to close, Ashwin informed us that our next hostel does not have very good reviews. Standing at 1.5/5.0 stars on trip advisor, **Lakeside Backpackers** had absolutely horrible ratings and comments. Heres a little snapshot from [tripadvisor](https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Hotel_Review-g255122-d3423672-Reviews-Lakeside_Backpackers-Queenstown_Otago_Region_South_Island.html#REVIEWS).

&nbsp;

With reviews like this, paranoia crept in as we sat in our silver Honda Civic as we reviewed our options. We had no darned alternative. Hakim was so paranoid that he did not even bathe that night (he even left all his belongings in the vehicle).

Well, it wasn't that bad after all, personally I would rate it at 2.8/5. It was a unique experience - when I was showering, there was a couple from Chile showering together beside my cubicle. They were blasting obnoxiously loud spanish songs and making (ahem) weird noises. Other than that, nothing eventful happened - we even managed to catch up with Game Of Thrones ep 3 & 4 (Those episodes are awesome).

Obviously, tripadvisor should not to be treated as a bible.

&nbsp;

### **Day 9: Ben Lomand and Ferging good burgers**

&nbsp;

We took a gondola up to a few hundred metres. From there we began on quest - to conquer the summit of Ben Loman. The day before, we rented crampons (Spiked attachments for our boots) as we were told that there would be melting ice close to the summit. Those crampons were life savers.

&nbsp;
<img src="images/NZ2017/ben-lomand.JPG">
&nbsp;

We made it to the top in around 4 hours. On the summit, there was a giant compass looking device that pointed to different mountains around the vicinity (not too sure how they brought that up). It was bloody freezing at sub-zero wind temperatures. We gobbled our lunch and headed down immediately. We took maybe 2 hours to make it to the bottom as we hobbled along quickly in our crampons.

We tried the famous Queenstown Fergburgers at night. It was pretty darned good, but not extraordinary. (Maybe we were just calory-starved from the climb). I would say that they are a notch above Carls' Junior, and they have an undeserving (and unbelievably) long queue. A prime example of marketing done well!

### **Day 10: Leap of faith** 

We headed towards Mt. Cook. Along the way, we made a pit stop at Kawairu Bridge to make a short 43 metre jump off the bridge. 

The jump did not look too intimidating at first - until you are at the edge of the bridge. As you stare down into the icy pale river, a mini panic attack sets in. By then, you have not much chance to react as the person behind you shouts "3, 2, 1, JUMP!". Off you go, swan diving off the bridge. After 5 seconds, you find yourself dangling around the sky like a roasted pig.

Another thing checked off my bucket list (But I would find a taller bridge next time). I guess you could call me an adrenaline junkie now.

&nbsp;

### **Day 11: Silly Tarns and Hooker Valley**

&nbsp;

Once again, we craved for another adventure, a more treacherous and epic journey.

> At that stage of my youth, death remained as abstract a concept as non-Euclidean geometry or marriage. I didn't yet appreciate its terrible finality or the havoc it would 
> wreak on those who'd entrusted the deceased with their hearts. I was stirred by the dark mystery of mortality. I couldn't resist stealing up to the edge of doom and peering over the brink.

**Excerpt taken from Into The Wild (Jon Krakauer)** 

&nbsp;

On hindsight, this is my forth mountaineous expedition in the year 2017. Let me try to illustrate the pains and joys of mountaineering.

At first, we begin the climb fresh, chirpy, optimistic and chatty. As time passes, your attention sharpens and you begin climbing with intense focus as the journey becomes more dangerous. As you focus, you no longer notice the raw knuckles, the cramping thighs and the strain of maintaining a nonstop concentration. A trancelike state settles over your efforts as you brain seems to reprogramme itself. Your calculated movements seem to become subconscious. Hours begin to slide by like minutes. The accumalated clutter of day-to-day existence are all temporarily forgotten.

Sealy Tarns is well known as the 'stairway to heaven', it consists of 2200 steps all the way to the top of the landform. The journey started off pleasent. We ascended slowly, step by step. As we progressed, the snow thickened, making it harder for us to navigate. Eventually, we lost track of the steps as it was buried completely by a thick fluffy coat of snow which rised up to our waist level. As if probing for landmines, we stuck our ice axes randomly into the snow, hoping that we could find the steps. Ashwin and Hakim attempted to traverse the mountain, below which was a death plunge that reached kilometers from where we are. Falling into it may prove fatal - a premature cryogenic act that may make you the next mammoth in a futuristic museum.

We came to our senses and aborted mission impossible. Defeated, we turned back and headed to the easier track that had a rather promiscuous name: Hooker's Valley. Hooker's Valley is a very tourist friendly track unlike Sealy Tarns. It was littered with huge grey bolders that were curiously placed. Glacier colored streams meandered through the track. As we climbed to a decent height, there it was staring down on us. The almighty Mt. Cook, sitting high above on it's throne. Right below it sat a lake that had thin ice sheets floating right above it. It was a glorious sight to behold.

We returned to the car, drove to Lake Tekapo and relaxed in the warm hot springs.

### **Day 12: AirBnb in Christchurch**

Nothing much was achieved other than driving to Christchurch. But oh man, the AirBnb was luxurious. Should have done more AirBnbs along the way. 

### **Day 13: Skiing Finale**

On our last day, we decided to ski. We rented ski equipment and set out for Porter's first thing in the morning. The last time I skiied was in Korea(?), I can't even remember. Skiing was awesome! I managed to pick it up pretty fast (muscle memory maybe). You can check out the short gopro compilation I did on [instagram](www.instagram.com/jobunts).

Thats all folks! Feel free to ask me anything about NZ - If you want, you can even get our itinerary through email. Special thanks to Hakim, Ashwin and Xuan Yi for keeping me alive and well. <i class="em em---1"></i>
