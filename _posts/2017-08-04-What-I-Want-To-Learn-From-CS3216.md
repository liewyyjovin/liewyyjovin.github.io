## **What is CS3216?**


### **At first glance, what is a business student like myself doing in a level 3000 CS module?**

[Ben Leong on CS3216](https://www.facebook.com/notes/ben-leong/on-cs3216cs3217-and-elitism/10153053255577549/)

> CS3216 and CS3217 are great classes mostly because we have a high selection bar and the great experience is created mainly by the students themselves. 

**This made me excited.**

In an idealised world of academia, it has an image of an idyllic location filled with smart people; even more so with the sense that one can become smarter simply through osmosis. A place of continual geekiness, where ideas are unbounded, and a magical place for hackers to just enjoy themselves.

Ever since I working in [99.co](99.co), I have always pined for working with smart, awesome people, on an awesome project that we are all passionate about. Perhaps I have been infected by the good, smart folks over at [99.co](99.co). But ever since, I have seen the power of collaboration. The thrill, excitement and experience gleaned from working with the brightest and most passionate people in the Singapore startup scene.

CS3216 is my best bet to replicate that scenario. I secretly (and selfishly) hope that I am the worst student in the module - as this will accelerate my learning curve and force
 me out of my comfort zone. Impression wise, CS3216 is already doing a good job in setting the tone. Creating my own blog has been a long standing dream. This was the final push. 


## **What do I want to learn?**

### **Being happy is all about matching expectations to reality.**

**My expectations are high for this module.**

I expect that I can find really talented and smart people in the course, people who inspire me to strive harder everyday, people who are proactive and takes the initiative to speak up and share their ideas. 

I expect that the curriculum will be very intensive. So much so that it consumes my whole semester. In anticipation, I have tried my best to take complementary modules. FIN2004, MNO2009, GEQ1000 and MKT2414. Hopefully MNO2009 (Entrepreneurship) and MKT2414 (Facebook Marketing Challenge) gives me as much inspiration as i need for CS3216. Additionally, this combination is to make sure that I have a very lean schedule, with as little examinable modules as possible. Apparently GEQ1000 & MKT2414 are CS/CU modules, which frees up even more time for 3216.

I expect to learn every aspect about web development. Not just the business aspect. Not just the development or design aspect. But every aspect. This is a tall order, but I hope to push myself and distill every single drop of knowledge that is made available to me. Learning is more than creating knowledge, but putting it into action. With CS3216, we would be able to put our projects into action meaningfully.

I look forward to the learning and hardship from CS3216. <i class="em em-smile"></i>
