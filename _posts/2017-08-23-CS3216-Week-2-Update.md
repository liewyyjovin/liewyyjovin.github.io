## **CS3216 Assignment 1: NUSEats**

**And so it begins.**

This module is intense. Immediately, we are tasked to form teams and begin on our first assignment - A facebook Web Application. Our team is made up of the following composition: A backend engineer, frontend engineer, full stack engineer and me (Business / UI + UX Designer). We curated a list of ideas over the next 3 days and ranked it accordingly.

One idea that I found particularly interesting: A 'motherbot', and I mean the mother of all chatbots - A bot that can enter into other bots using a simple command. For example, /taxibot brings you into the bot, and /exit brings you back to the motherbot. The idea was interesting - A directory of bots whereby a user can easily access any other bots. One no longer needs to have multiple chatbots. No more clutter.

However, we found that we fell short on the tech side. In the end, we decided to make full use of the facebook API. NUSeats was concieved. We envision an app whereby people could send meal invites to anyone else. There are many use cases for this app. A professor could make use of the app to do consultations (even better: treat students to a meal). People could send invites to each other and network over a meal or coffee. Marketers could advertise their products by offering free food or coffee. I am sure our users will think of even more use cases.

 Most importantly: Food is a very social activity. Humans do not actually have to eat 3 meals a day. We can perfectly function well if we skip a few meals a day (Some may even argue that we function better without breakfast). If not, more people will actually consider doing intermittent fasting - which claims to have many 'benefits' associated with it.

## **Features, features, features..**

For features, we decided that 4 weeks will only grant us sufficient time for 3 main features, subject to changes depending on how fast we finish them.

Firstly, the main function of the app is to allow people to connect to each other through a meal. Obviously, the main feature will be a feed of sorts that allows users to create groups, join groups and to aid discovery of new groups that are interesting. This will be similar to a facebook feed feature, whereby people can see comment and like different activities that are going on throughout the campus. 

Our second feature is simpler. It is just a cataloguing feature, whereby we gather data on all the food in school - curate a database of food and create a peer review system. Something like burrple, but NUS centric. This is to allow discovery of food, locations people can meet at and eat at.

Lastly, we want to integrate a google map view. People can see different groups and activities going on through the map view, also, to have a filter of sorts to choose the kind of food they are looking for. E.g: Halal, Price of food, etc... (This will only be built if there is enough time)

## **CS3216 Assignment 2: What's in store?**

The idea behind assignment 2 is to allow us to find out what apps currently exist out there. After discussing with my group, we found out that it is actually difficult to select an interesting app to critique. Most of us know of recent startups, but these are deep tech startups. Im talking about startups that does new databases (VoltDB), robo trading (StashAway), crazy algos and all. We realised it is actually hard to critique these as our knowledge are very much limited in those fields. We started researching on consumer facing apps instead. 

The funny thing was that I rode an Obike to Yale-NUS (Where we met), and I was telling my teammates how awesome Obikes are and how i covered 100++km within a short few months. That conversation made us choose Obike as our first choice. We also picked facebook Moments - A pretty nifty product created by facebook to solve the problem of photo sharing in the mobile age. And lastly, a productivity app called Forest. Apparently,they plant a **real** tree everytime you focus for a few hours. Thats pretty cool.

So far im enjoying the module, it is definitely more fun compared to my "Entrepreneurship Module", MNO2009, whereby they attempt to teach entrepreneurship academically through lecture slides (dear lord) and writing academic papers. <i class="em em-sweat_smile"></i>

Looking forward to even more suffering.
