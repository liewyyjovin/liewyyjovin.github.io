**STePs Poster for SGInnovate Talnet - It has been a hell of a ride.**
## **It has been a hell of a ride**##

So, we just finished the 11th STePs yesterday night (16th of November 2017). And finally, we manage to see all the completed projects in one exhibition. Calvin and Serene actualy took time off to come down and support our teams (SGI Pathfinder & SGI Talnet). I must really say that CS3216 is the best module I have ever taken so far in NUS. And that is coming from a person with a business administration background.

## **The best project goes too...**##

I believe that the top prize should actually go to **Aurum**, the Cryptocurrency Mining Management Platform. I spoke to Marty briefly during the exhibition and learned alot about his project. It was an insane opportunity that most of us did not take because of our skepticism. That was a huge mistake. That project is insanely interesting, not to mention the opportunities involved in it, but also the crazy high pay that they got. A few pointers to note:

1) They had an initial payout of 10k for their whole team (Which has 3 people)
2) There is a vague promise of 500k if they hit their revenue targets
3) Darren, albeit shady, is an amazing entrepreneur who gets his hands dirty with real stuff
4) Come on, it is crypto after all - people go wild over these stuff
5) Crazy interesting - A whole new sphere/paradigm that I have never encountered/explored before

Now with that being said, one could only wish that they have adopted the contrarian mindset before, and actually did what seemed the riskiest, most counter intuitive project there is out there.

Despite this, the actual winners of STePS was HunQRy and Pear - they are probably the most intuitive and consumer facing applications out there. Hence, I guess they kind of deserved it. Besides, they have some kickass marketing and user acquisition, which is pretty cool in my opinion.

## **What's next?** ##

This year has been simply amazing year for me.

99.co (EA to COO) > CS3216 > SGInnovate Product Internship > Grab Product Manager Intern > NOC Silicon Valley (Jul 2018)

This year has been the most productive year in my life thus far, and I would say that I am now addicted to the grind. I have been learning so much, from very talented, passionate individuals from different verticals and industries. I hope that I can continue this momentum, and eventually build a product and team that I myself am very passionate about. My teammates from SGInnovate Talnet will be continuing their part time job with SGInnovate at an astounding pay of $3000, part time (Not pro-rated). I myself will be heading down to 1 Cecil Street to slave off for Grab as a Product Manager Intern. In return, I hope to learn how a scrappy product team runs, AGILE processes, workflows and corporate strategy. Hopefully, there will be plenty to learn from the experience. 

CS3216 really opened up alot of opportunities for me. I never thought that I would be doing so much interesting things this year, especially things that are outside of the cirriculum. This has really made me question the value of my current education as well. It also gave me a healthy dose of skepticism on internet products. Especially since almost everything has been tried out. Those that are worthed trying are really hard to come by, or even, still a secret waiting to be discovered.

On a side note, I will be heading down to Silicon Valley for NUS Overseas College for a year. I spoke to some seniors previously and they mentioned that I should start applying to companies now. Currently, I am combing through [yclist.com](yclist.com) to check out cool Y combinator startups that I can apply to. Im gonna do a full out hustling of applying probably in the December period. After all, I will be working there for a year. If I end up working in a zombie startup, its gonna a year of suffering.

My ideal startup would be one that is created by a crazy entrepreneur, with meaningful value add and with a small amount of employees. Hopefully, one that is ready to scale in an amazing way. But again, how common will these startups be? And also, what would make them hire me. But this is the exciting part of the journey and I am really looking forward to meeting the brightest in Slicon Valley next year. Bye bye NUS, hello Stanford. :)

This will be my final blog post on the CS3216 series. I have been thinking of redesigning this blog with the new CSS/HTML/Javascript skills that I have picked up in CS3216. The next time you see this blog, I promise that it will look sexier.
