## **I have been too stressed out over things i can't control** ##

Working with an external vendor is not as easy as it seems.

1) You do not have absolute control over the direction of the project

2) Your client does not know what he/she wants 

3) Be prepared to change your roadmap a thousand times  

That being said, I have been overly concerned about getting the details right for the first two weeks, which was a terrible mistake. Not only I wasted my time doing wireframes and screens that will never see daylight - I was also trying too hard to brainstorm for ideas alone.

Now, this is a sin for all product managers. Instead of 'hiding in the cave' and trying to generate ideas, a PM should be talking to his team, talking to the clients - bouncing ideas here and there until a satisfying answer is derived. Communication is key to success.

## **Mad, mad sprints** ##

As student contractors, we had a bunch to worry about. We have to satisfy both prof. colin and SGI. Because of various reasons, they may ask us to build products in two completely different directions? (Although i really do appreciate colin for bailing us out of a potentially boring and mind numbing product)

So then, how did our team navigate this treacherous field of landmines?

Mad, mad sprints is the answer. Every week, we hack out a scrappy core feature - after which, we refine it aggressively. For example, we hacked out touch-point in 3 days. Currently, we are in the midst of hacking out an even bigger core feature - auto-tagging of JDs & auto-matching of talents to JDs. Due to the complexity of how information is handled in SGInnovate, this took abit of planning to execute.

This strategy has proven to be successful to date. Our first product is well liked by SGI. In the next few weeks, we will retain this agile, lean method and continue iterating and improving our product.

There is certainly beauty in the uncertainty. Although we have no idea how our final product will look like, we know we are on the right track.
