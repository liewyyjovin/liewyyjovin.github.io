## **Why does this weblog exist?**
&nbsp;

The primary purpose of this weblog is summed up by this tiny nugget of wisdom.

&nbsp;
> If you cannot write well, you cannot think well; if you cannot think well, others will do the thinking for you

**- Oscar Wilde**
&nbsp;

In fact, this has been a long standing project that was constantly shelved in my seemingly infinite to-do list. I have finally found time and energy to do it during my 2-week long New Zealand [trip](/incredible-new-zealand). A chain of unrelated events actually pushed me to do this for real.

## **A few guidelines for myself in the future**
&nbsp;

1) This blog is mainly for myself; to read, think and write. It is completely fine if it is lost and undiscovered in the vast internet jungle.

2) Anyone should be able to comment, critique and speak out to me. I love it when my views are challenged. (Who dosen't?)

3) In case I become too busy to add new content, this blog also serves as a memory database for my ageing brain.

4) My vision for this blog is to make it a personal directory. One where I have everything from links to different projects to book reviews, travel reviews and so on.

5) Once I publish something, I will not edit the post. I will only do so explicitly (Add in an Edited tag or something at the bottom of the article), unless it is a negligble change.

6) This is not the final version of the blog, it will be constantly updated with pages, features and other fun good stuff. (Follow the action at my Git rep)

## **Features to be built**
&nbsp;

Just for myself to note, these are the features that I would built in the future if time and energy permits. If you see something that is blank or wandered into a page that does not make sense, fret not, it is either bad code or something in progress. This blog is powered by **Jekyll** and **Github Pages** (for those who are curious).

1) Project Page - A link to all the other websites where my projects exists

2) Pagination - When I have way too many posts (Will be Javascript enabled)

3) Series Page - Something similar to tagging, but more of different chapters to a certain topic

4) Book Reviews - A book review page, where I rank all the favourite books that I read + Snippets of favourite quotes

As time passes, more feature ideas will be added.
